This book is not about not giving a f\*ck about nothng but instead to choose wisely which f\*ck to
give to whom. It takes the whole human existence from another prospective, one I never thought about.
Even though someone who reads does not have to accept all his thinkering, it's a good insight for 
thinking outside the box and seeing the world upside-down. This book I would say it's not for the stubborn, they will definetely criticize it and never learn nothing. Instead I will reccomend to read it in a uncertain moment of your life or simply now, to just get another idea of life. It takes courage to apply some concepts outlined in the book, but it will be more regretful not applying them
now. The book is full of tabu concepts such as death, giving fuck, sex and other things but it's a very good outline of the human nature. Therefore if you are somehow puzzled by this comment I suggest to read this book with a cosmic view (such as Nietzsche's) and try little by little to put toghether the pieces and big image of your life will be enhanced.
