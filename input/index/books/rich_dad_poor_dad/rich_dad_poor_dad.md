This book is the number one book about financial education of all time. I discovered it thanks to my dad, who strongly reccomended it if I wanted to know more about money. I was a bit sceptical at the beginning but in the end it turned out very helpful. I started desiring a tesla since I got my driving licence. It cost some money and therefore I started thinking how I can afford it and I came up with different ideas and projects to raise money. None of them was applicable or easy to do. Discouraged I wanted to learn more about this process that seemed so difficoult for me but maybe it was easy for somebody else. The book was a gift. I learned all the basics concepts of how money works and the game of debt is played. The author explaines very well some abstract concepts in way of stories of himself and his path to achive financia freedom. This simple two words are the main concept of this abstract as Robert cite them again and again. It means being in a state of not worriyng about one's money situation. It means that you can live without working forever and still having food on the table at the end of the day. This might sound a bit scary ot risky at first, but that is another strong point of the book: taking care of the risk and not avoiding it. Overall I would say that this book made me grow a lot, I discovered a new world that I never took into account before. I was so amazed that I also read the sequel: the cashflow quadrant. Another book which I  strongly raccomend to anyone who wants to have a broader view on the argument.
